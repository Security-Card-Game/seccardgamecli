# SecCardGame CLI

At some time in point this will be a simple tool to create cards and decks 
for the [securityDeckGame](https://github.com/maschmi/securityDeckGame).

The plan is to allow for:

* card creation
* checkout the card repository
* create a deck while specifying how many cards to use in total and how many cards from which type
* maybe even create a simple GUI to show the drawn cards - you will still need a dice and keep track of resources ;)

## Why in rust?

Because I want to learn it ;)

## Why not Apple Silicon binary`?

Because it was not working out of the box. Feel free to fix it - otherwise if time allows
it will be done.
