# How to contribute

We're a small group of main contributors driving this project further as capacity and energy allows. If you'd like to make a contribution, here's how to go about it.

## You found a bug, have an idea for an enhancement, or want to share any other kind of feedback?
Feel free to create an issue and we'll review it. Bear in mind that this is a leisure time project, so it might take some time until we can come back to you. Your feedback is appreciated nonetheless!

## You have a concrete suggestion implemented?
You're welcome to raise a PR. Just make sure to include your reasoning and solution approach in the description. We can't promise to merge it as is, yet we will review it and come back to you.

## You'd like to become a playtester?
You're very welcome to do so! Just open an issue, and we'll use it to figure out details together.

## You'd like to join our main contributor group for more regular and core contributions?
We'd love to hear from you and see where this journey leads us. Just open an issue, and we'll come back to you to figure out a shared communication channel so we can get to know each other.
